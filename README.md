# ELARA

**Personal AI Computer Assistant — Developed by Tan**

ELARA is a local-first, cloud-ready personal AI system built around **DeepSeek Harness (DSH)** as the single harness layer. The project adds ELARA-specific plugins and integrations instead of rewriting the harness core.

## Design rules

1. **Reuse first, adapt second, rewrite last.**
2. DSH remains an upstream runtime; ELARA changes live in plugins/adapters.
3. The laptop executor is treated as a separate trusted device boundary.
4. Remote commands never become an unrestricted Windows shell by default.
5. Local mode must be able to become cloud mode without changing the device protocol.
6. OwnHermes V2 is optional and is not the foundation of ELARA.

## Current status

Phase 0 scaffold. No upstream DSH source is vendored into this repository; the official runtime is cloned into the ignored `.runtime/` directory during local bootstrap.

## Prerequisites

DeepSeek Harness currently documents Node.js **22.19+ or 24+**, pnpm 11.7.0 via Corepack, and Git 2.26+. Native Windows development is supported; WSL2 is optional. The current DSH development guide documents Node 22.19+ or 24+ and pnpm 11.7.0. See the official development guide before bootstrapping. 

## Local bootstrap

From PowerShell:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass
.\scripts\bootstrap-local.ps1
```

The bootstrap script clones the official DeepSeek Harness repository into `.runtime/deepseek-harness`, installs its dependencies, and creates an ELARA patch overlay without modifying the upstream source tree.

## Run

```powershell
.\scripts\run-local.ps1
```

The first milestone is deliberately small: prove that ELARA can load as a DSH plugin, expose an ELARA identity, and report Windows system status.

## Planned channels

- WhatsApp via Baileys
- Telegram Bot API
- Laptop dashboard
- Future cloud gateway
